Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant external knowledge before generating responses.

Vector databases store embeddings that capture semantic meaning rather than exact keywords.

BM25 is a ranking function used in information retrieval based on term frequency and inverse document frequency.

Chunking is the process of splitting large documents into smaller pieces to improve retrieval accuracy.

Reranking uses cross-encoder models to score query-document pairs more accurately than vector similarity alone.
